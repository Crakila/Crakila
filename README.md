### Hi, I'm Crakila 👋
#### Lurker, Learner, Gamer from Carlow, Ireland

##### Small bit about the programming side of things
I am a beginner, learning little bits of bits and pieces but nothing to really show for it. 

* I'm a contributor with front-end related bits and bobs over at [@XIVStats](https://github.com/XIVStats)
* I know HTML and CSS and could whip up something basic if needed.

### By Night
By night, you'll find me playing [Final Fantasy XIV: Online](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com).
