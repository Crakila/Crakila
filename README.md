### Hi, I'm Crakila 👋
#### Lurker, Learner, Gamer from Carlow, Ireland

##### Small bit about the programming side of things
I am a beginner, learning little bits of Python but nothing to really show for it. 

* I'm a contributor with front-end related bits and bobs over at [@XIVStats](https://github.com/XIVStats)
* I know HTML and CSS and could whip up something basic if needed.

### By Day
I work for [Blacknight Internet Solutions](https://blacknight.com) helping customers out with domains, web hosting, WordPress, emails, SSL's, ~~Office~~ Microsoft 365, and more! 

(I am looking for a new job. Email me `p at pf dot ie` if you want a copy of my CV) 

### By Night
By night, you'll find me playing [Final Fantasy XIV: Online](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com). When I am not playing FFXIV, I can be found on my new site [XIV Hotel](https://xivhotel.com/).

I also look after [SmallBusinessIreland.ie](https://instagram.com/smallbusinessireland.ie) Instagram page.
