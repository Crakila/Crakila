### Hi, I'm Crakila 👋
#### Lurker, Learner, Gamer from Carlow, Ireland

##### Small bit about the programming side of things
I am a beginner, learning little bits of Python but nothing to really show for it. 

* I'm a contributor with front-end related bits and bobs over at [@XIVStats](https://github.com/XIVStats)
* I know HTML and CSS and could whip up something basic if needed.

### By Day
I work for [Imagine Broadband](https://www.imagine.ie) helping customers out with wireless broadband in rural parts of Ireland! <br />
* I previously worked for [Blacknight Internet Solutions](https://blacknight.com)

### By Night
By night, you'll find me playing [Final Fantasy XIV: Online](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com). When I am not playing FFXIV, I can be found on my new site [XIV Hotel](https://xivhotel.com/).

I also look after [SmallBusinessIreland.ie](https://instagram.com/smallbusinessireland.ie) Instagram page.
